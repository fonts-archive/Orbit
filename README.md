## 다이나믹 서브셋

웹폰트의 최적화를 위해 모던 브라우저에서는 글리프를 여러개로 나누어 필요한 부분만 동적으로 파싱하는 다이나믹 서브셋을 제공합니다. 폰트의 용량이 부담된다면 아래 코드를 사용하는 걸 추천합니다.

### HTML

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/fonts-archive/Orbit/subsets/Orbit-dynamic-subset.css" type="text/css"/>
```

### CSS

```css
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/fonts-archive/Orbit/subsets/Orbit-dynamic-subset.css");
```

## font-family

어느 브라우저나 시스템 환경에서도 동일한 폰트가 적용되어야 한다면 아래와 같이 구성하는 걸 추천합니다. `-apple-system`과 `BlinkMacSystemFont`는 맥, `Segoe UI`는 윈도우, `Roboto`는 안드로이드의 기본 폰트입니다.

```css
font-family: "Orbit", -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI",Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, "Open Sans", "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif;
```
